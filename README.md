gitlab-ls-registry
---

This is a simple PHP console command to fetch useful Docker registry data from GitLab. I
wrote it because I couldn't figure out how to do this (a) the Docker way, or (b) using
the official GitLab API.

It is not finished, but the classes that do exist are pretty self-explanatory. Use
an IDE to get auto-complete on the `GitLab` class.
